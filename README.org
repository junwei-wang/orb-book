** Usage

*** Add a book

This project is in its very early stage, a book add functionality hasn't been implemented.

However, one can add a book to the database manually by following the following three steps:

1. Add a bib entry to your *.bib file via =M-x orb-book-add-book=.
2. Add a org-roam-bibtex note for this bib entry.
3. Add tag =book= for this note by updating its =FILETAGS= property.

In the future, this process will be automated in this project.

*** Search a book

Simply execute =M-x orb-book-find-helm=.
